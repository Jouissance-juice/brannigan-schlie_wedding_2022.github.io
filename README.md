# Brannigan-Schlie Wedding 2022

#### Welcome to our wedding site! This will be the hub for announcements and information for our friends and family. 
We know a lof of people are coming from far-away places, so hopefully this will make your trip planning a bit easier. We are getting married on July 23rd, 2022, at the Beverly Mansion in Marengo, Ohio. We are putting together a pretty awesome party, if we do say so ourselves. Be prepared for lots of dancing, some karaoke, an art project, and a few other surprises!

#### Be sure to check back in the next couple of months for more info about our pre-party and after-party! You can make a whole weekend out of celebrating our nuptials :-D

## Please Provide Your Contact Information!

We are trying to streamline the invitation process as much as possible. Our strategy is to send out hard copies of the save-the-date announcement followed by virtual invitations. We don't have everyone's info, so if you could please visit this survey and fill out your details, that would help us out a lot!

## Accommodations

We recommend getting accommodations in Mt. Vernon. It's about a 15-minute drive from the venue. Plus, it's a super cute town! We are working with The Mount Vernon Grand Hotel to provide some guaranteed rooms for our out-of-town guests, which are basically all of the guests! Currently, we are reserving 39 rooms for Saturday (the maximum) and 15 for Friday, but we can reserve more for Friday as needed. If you can, please try and stay at the Grand Hotel so that we can honor our agreement for reserved rooms.

- We haven't spoken to anyone at the Comfort Inn, but it is located close to the Grand. We may reach out to them if rooms at the Grand start to sell out.

### Nearby areas:
In the event that rooms sell out at the Grand and the Comfort Inn, you can search nearby areas. Polaris is about 30 minutes away, but it has plenty of hotels. There are lots of restaurants and shopping at Polaris as well, but it is not as busy as Columbus proper. Delaware and Mansfield are both nice towns, also around 30 minutes from the the Beverly Mansion.
