#### Welcome to our wedding site! This will be the hub for announcements and information for our friends and family. 
We know a lof of people are coming from faraway places, so hopefully this will make your trip planning a bit easier. The wedding is July 23rd, 2022, at the Beverly Mansion in Marengo, Ohio. We are putting together a pretty rockin' party, if we do say so ourselves. Be prepared for lots of dancing, a little karaoke, a tiny art project, and a few surprises!

#### Be sure to check back in the next couple of months for more info about our pre-party and after-party! You can make a whole weekend out of celebrating our nuptials :-D

### Welcome Party
On Friday evening, we'll be hanging out at a pavilion at the Ariel-Foundation Park in Mt. Vernon, which is very close to the town square and The Mount Vernon Grand. Come see us on our last evening as single folk! We'll feed you pizza, sody-pops, and the like, and we'll have some party games on hand. Bring the kiddos!

## Accommodations

We recommend getting accommodations in Mt. Vernon. It's about a 15-minute drive from the venue. Plus, it's a super cute town! We are working with The Mount Vernon Grand Hotel to provide some guaranteed rooms for our out-of-town guests, which are most of the guests! Currently, we are reserving 39 rooms for Saturday (the maximum) and 15 for Friday, but we can set aside more for Friday as needed. If you can, please try and stay at the Grand Hotel so that we can honor our agreement.

### Nearby areas:
In the event that rooms sell out at the Grand and the Comfort Inn, you can search nearby areas. Polaris is about 30 minutes away, but it has plenty of hotels. There are lots of restaurants and shopping at Polaris as well, but it is not as busy as Columbus proper. Delaware and Mansfield are both nice towns, also around 30 minutes from the the Beverly Mansion.
